The image shows a heatmap of the use by weekday and by gender. This is a summary of what we have seen before, the majority of users are males during the working days.
 

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

In order to start the bike-sharing business in Des Moines, we can be sure the main user will be male and during workdays. But as everybusiness, reaching profitability fast its important. Therefore I would create stations not based on the weekday used only, but on the entire week used. Therefore im using the full capacity of my bikes.

I would create a visualization to understand the routes for which the bikes are used the most, also i would create a visualization to understand the stations where there is more use all days of the week, therefore i can create  more profitable business since the start, and try to mirror those locations in Des Moines.
